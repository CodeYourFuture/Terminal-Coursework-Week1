# Terminal Coursework

In this coursework we want to test what you've learnt in the previous coursework.

## Tasks

### 1) Find my script

In this repository you'll find `MyDocuments` - this is all the documents that I use on my laptop.

I need to find the `script.js` file that is a part of MyFirstWebsite however you are **not** allowed to use a GUI, you must use Command Line and the Terminal.

What commands would I need to change directory to the directory containing `script.js`? In the section below, write all the commands you used.

Hint: You should use `cd` and `ls`.

#### 1) Answer

<!-- Write your answer here -->
<!--My Answers-->
To find the script.js file I used the following steps:
1) PWD -- to check the current working directory 
2) ls -- to see the list of folders and file in the repository
3) cd -- to go to MyDocuments
4) ls -- to see the list of files and folder in here
5) cd -- to change directory to go Projects folder
6) ls - to see the files and folder in Projects
7) cd - to go to MyFirstWebsite folder
8) ls - to see the list of files and folders here
9) cd -- to go from MyFirstWebsite to the scripts folder
10) ls -- to see the list of files and folders in scripts folder
Finally we can see our script.js file here.

### 3) Counting Script

Next, I want you to run the script in this directory

```
/MyDocuments/Scripts/
```

You can run the script by typing

```
./count_to_100.sh
```

when you're in the correct directory.

For this task, I want you to **stop** the counter when I have counted to 10.

#### 3) Answer

Copy the output of the script here

<!-- Write your answer here -->
I have counted to 1

I have counted to 9

In this directory you'll find a quick quiz for you to complete

```
/MyDocuments/Quiz

You should open the quiz in Visual Studio Code and complete it. You can do this either by opening this project in VSCode or by running the command

```sh
code QUIZ.md
```

when you're in the correct directory.
