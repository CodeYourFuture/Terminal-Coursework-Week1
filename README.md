# Terminal Coursework

In this coursework we want to test what you've learnt in the previous coursework.

## Tasks

### 1) Find my script

In this repository you'll find `MyDocuments` - this is all the documents that I use on my laptop.

I need to find the `script.js` file that is a part of MyFirstWebsite however you are **not** allowed to use a GUI, you must use Command Line and the Terminal.

What commands would I need to change directory to the directory containing `script.js`? In the section below, write all the commands you used.

Hint: You should use `cd` and `ls`.

#### 1) Answer


  685  pwd
  686  ls
  687  cd MyDocuments
  688  ls
  689  cd Scripts
  690  ls
  691  cd ..
  692  cd Projects
  693  ls
  694  cd MyFirstWebsite
  695  ls
  696  cd scripts
  697  ls

### 2) Find my Hotel Photo

Great work!

Next, I want to try and find the photo of my hotel from my holiday in July that I want to send to a friend.

**Note**: You should do this by moving from where you are after completing the previous task.

#### 2) Answer

  695  cd ..
  696  ls
  697  cd ..
  698  ls
  699   cd ..
  700  ls
  701  cd Photos
  702  ls
  703  cd HolidayJuly
  704  ls
  705  cd Hotel
  706  ls

### 3) Counting Script

Next, I want you to run the script in this directory

/MyDocuments/Scripts/

You can run the script by typing
 
./count_to_100.sh

when you're in the correct directory.

For this task, I want you to **stop** the counter when I have counted to 10.



#### 3) Answer

Copy the output of the script here

  685   ls
  686  cd MyDocuments
  687  ls
  688  cd Scripts
  689  ls
  690  open count_to_100.sh

  press Ctrl+ C


### 4) Quiz

In this directory you'll find a quick quiz for you to complete

```
/MyDocuments/Quiz
```

You should open the quiz in Visual Studio Code and complete it. You can do this either by opening this project in VSCode or by running the command

```sh
code QUIZ.md
```

when you're in the correct directory.
