# Terminal Coursework

In this coursework we want to test what you've learnt in the previous coursework.

## Tasks

### 1) Find my script

In this repository you'll find `MyDocuments` - this is all the documents that I use on my laptop.

I need to find the `script.js` file that is a part of MyFirstWebsite however you are **not** allowed to use a GUI, you must use Command Line and the Terminal.

What commands would I need to change directory to the directory containing `script.js`? In the section below, write all the commands you used.

Hint: You should use `cd` and `ls`.

#### 1) Answer

<!-- Write your answer here -->

we use cd commands to go the other folder , and we use ls it means list to show us which files are in are folder .

### 2) Find my Hotel Photo

Great work!

Next, I want to try and find the photo of my hotel from my holiday in July that I want to send to a friend.

**Note**: You should do this by moving from where you are after completing the previous task.

#### 2) Answer

<!-- Write your answer here -->

1. I used pwd to show me where I am.
2. I used ls to show me which folder it is in.
3. I used cd mydocuments to go in the folder.
4. I used ls to show me again which folder it is in.
5. I used cd photos to go in the photos folder.
6. I used ls again to see what is in this folder.
7. I used cd holidayjuly to go in the folder.
8. then I used again ls to shom me what is in folder.

### 3) Counting Script

Next, I want you to run the script in this directory

```
/MyDocuments/Scripts/
```

You can run the script by typing

```
./count_to_100.sh
```

when you're in the correct directory.

For this task, I want you to **stop** the counter when I have counted to 10.

#### 3) Answer

Copy the output of the script here

<!-- Write your answer here -->

I have counted to 1
I have counted to 2
I have counted to 3
I have counted to 4
I have counted to 5
I have counted to 6
I have counted to 7
I have counted to 8
I have counted to 9
I have counted to 10
You should have used Ctrl+C to end the script by now! I have counted to 10!

### 4) Quiz

In this directory you'll find a quick quiz for you to complete

```
/MyDocuments/Quiz
```

You should open the quiz in Visual Studio Code and complete it. You can do this either by opening this project in VSCode or by running the command

```sh
code QUIZ.md
```

when you're in the correct directory.
