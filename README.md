# Terminal Coursework

In this coursework we want to test what you've learnt in the previous coursework.

## Tasks

### 1) Find my script

In this repository you'll find `MyDocuments` - this is all the documents that I use on my laptop.

I need to find the `script.js` file that is a part of MyFirstWebsite however you are **not** allowed to use a GUI, you must use Command Line and the Terminal.

What commands would I need to change directory to the directory containing `script.js`? In the section below, write all the commands you used.

Hint: You should use `cd` and `ls`.

#### 1) Answer

<!-- Write your answer here -->
pwd to know my current location
ls to list all the folders
cd MyDocuments to go into this folder
ls to list all the folders in the MyDocument folder
cd Projects to move to this folder
ls to list all the folders in this folder
cd MyFirstWebsite
ls to list the folders inside MyFirstWebsite
cd scripts
ls to list all the folders and there I can see the script.js file



### 2) Find my Hotel Photo

Great work!

Next, I want to try and find the photo of my hotel from my holiday in July that I want to send to a friend.

**Note**: You should do this by moving from where you are after completing the previous task.

#### 2) Answer

<!-- Write your answer here -->
cd .. moved up to MyFirstWebsite
cd .. moved up again to Projects
cd .. moved up to MyDocuments
ls to list all the folders in MyDocuments were I have the Photos folder
cd Photos to move into this folder

cd HolidayJuly
ls to list all the folders inside the HolidayJuly
cd Hotel
ls to list all the folders inside the Hotel folder, here I can the cyf.png photo

### 3) Counting Script

Next, I want you to run the script in this directory

```
/MyDocuments/Scripts/
```

You can run the script by typing

```
./count_to_100.sh
```

when you're in the correct directory.

For this task, I want you to **stop** the counter when I have counted to 10.

### 4) Quiz

In this directory you'll find a quick quiz for you to complete

```
/MyDocuments/Quiz

You should open the quiz in Visual Studio Code and complete it. You can do this either by opening this project in VSCode or by running the command

```sh
code QUIZ.md
```

when you're in the correct directory.
